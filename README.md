# Yelp Review Sentiment Classifier (NLP Project)

This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify Yelp reviews as either 1-star (negative sentiment) or 5-star (positive sentiment). Using a dataset of 10,000 real Yelp reviews, the goal is to analyze text length distributions, clean text data, extract features via CountVectorizer and TF-IDF, and build a sentiment classification model.

## Features
- Data visualization and EDA
- Custom text cleaning pipeline with NLTK
- CountVectorizer & TF-IDF feature engineering
- Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment prediction
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and F1-score

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Accuracy
Achieved 93% accuracy on test data for binary classification (1-star vs 5-star).
